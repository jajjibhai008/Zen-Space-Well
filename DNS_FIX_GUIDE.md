# DNS Configuration Fix for GitHub Pages

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your domain `zenspacewell.com` has **extra IP addresses** that are preventing GitHub Pages from recognizing it properly.

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED**

### Step 1: Login to Your Domain Registrar
- Go to your domain registrar (where you bought zenspacewell.com)
- Navigate to DNS Management / DNS Settings

### Step 2: Fix A Records for zenspacewell.com
**REMOVE these incorrect IP addresses:**
- ❌ `76.223.105.230`
- ❌ `13.248.243.5`

**KEEP ONLY these GitHub Pages IPs:**
- ✅ `185.199.108.153`
- ✅ `185.199.109.153` 
- ✅ `185.199.110.153`
- ✅ `185.199.111.153`

### Step 3: Fix CNAME for www subdomain
**Current:** `www` → `zenspacewell.com` ❌  
**Change to:** `www` → `jajjibhai008.github.io` ✅

## 🔧 **Common Domain Registrars Instructions**

### GoDaddy:
1. Go to Domain Manager
2. Click DNS next to your domain
3. Edit A records, remove extra IPs
4. Edit CNAME for www

### Namecheap:
1. Go to Domain List
2. Click Manage next to your domain
3. Go to Advanced DNS tab
4. Edit A records and CNAME

### Cloudflare:
1. Go to DNS tab
2. Edit A records
3. Make sure proxy is OFF (gray cloud)

## ⏱️ **Timeline**
- **DNS changes:** 15 minutes - 24 hours to propagate
- **GitHub Pages recognition:** Usually within 1 hour after DNS is correct
- **SSL certificate:** Automatic after domain is verified

## 🧪 **Test Your Fix**
After making DNS changes, test with:
```bash
dig zenspacewell.com
```
Should show ONLY the 4 GitHub Pages IPs.

## 📞 **If Still Not Working**
1. Wait 24 hours for full DNS propagation
2. In GitHub Pages settings, remove and re-add your custom domain
3. Ensure "Enforce HTTPS" is checked
4. Check GitHub Pages status: https://www.githubstatus.com/

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
Once fixed, you should see:
- ✅ Custom domain working at https://zenspacewell.com
- ✅ HTTPS certificate automatically issued
- ✅ www.zenspacewell.com redirecting properly
- ✅ GitHub Pages recognizing your domain

The extra IPs you have are likely from a previous hosting service and are causing conflicts with GitHub Pages detection.

   - You'll get these after AdSense approval

3. **Ad Placements:**
   - Banner ad: Between hero and apps sections
   - Square ad: Between apps and FAQ sections
   - Additional placements can be added as needed

## Privacy Policy Requirements

## Revenue Potential

With your health/wellness niche:
- Expected RPM: $1-5 per 1000 pageviews
